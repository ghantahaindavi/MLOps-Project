# MLOps Implementation for Scalable Analytics Solutions

## Overview
This project is an **MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) pipeline** designed to automate the lifecycle of machine learning models. It ensures **scalability, automation, and reliability** in analytics solutions by integrating **cloud services, containerization, version control, and CI/CD pipelines**.

## Why is this important?
Traditional machine learning models often struggle with:
- **Scalability** â€“ Hard to process large datasets efficiently.
- **Model Management** â€“ Difficult to track and version models.
- **Automation** â€“ Manual deployment and retraining slow down productivity.
- **Reliability** â€“ Lack of monitoring leads to model degradation over time.

This project **solves these challenges** by leveraging:
- **Azure & Snowflake** for cloud-based data processing.
- **MLflow** for model tracking and versioning.
- **Docker** for containerized deployment.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** (GitHub Actions) for automation.

## How does it work?
The project follows a **structured workflow**:
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Data is cleaned and transformed using `data_preprocessing.py`.
2. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - The model is trained and evaluated using `model_training.py` and `model_evaluation.py`.
   - Experiment tracking is done via **MLflow**.
3. **Model Deployment & Serving**  
   - The trained model is deployed using **Docker** and served via `inference_api.py`.
4. **CI/CD Automation**  
   - Every new update is automatically tested and deployed using **GitHub Actions**.
5. **Monitoring & Version Control**  
   - **MLflow** stores different model versions for rollback or improvement.

## Features
- **Automated Model Training**: Data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.
- **Model Deployment**: Containerized deployment with Docker and Flask API for inference.
- **MLflow Integration**: Experiment tracking, model versioning, and performance monitoring.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment and testing.
- **Cloud-Based Data Processing**: Azure, Snowflake, and Databricks integration.

- Docker
- MLflow
- Azure Account (for cloud deployment)
- GitHub Actions enabled

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mlops-scalable-analytics.git
   cd mlops-scalable-analytics
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure your environment variables and settings in `config.yaml`.

### Running the ML Pipeline
Execute the training pipeline:
```sh
python train_pipeline.py
```

### Deploying with Docker
1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t mlops_model .
   ```
2. Run the container:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 5000:5000 mlops_model
   ```

### Using MLflow for Tracking
Run MLflow server:
```sh
mlflow ui --port 5001
```
Then, open `http://localhost:5001` in your browser to view experiment results.

## CI/CD Automation
